# Team Profile Generator [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description

This application is a team profile generator.  It takes input from the user and creates a html document with the information from the user included in the document.  It does this using inquirer to ask the questions it then uses a series of functions to create the document.  I made this application so that you can included a profile page in our upcoming project collaborations.
